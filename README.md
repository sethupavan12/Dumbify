# Dumbify
Dumbify is a Text Conversion Platform which can do the following when given text as an input:
1) Explain given text to a 2nd grader (This is wild! It can understand unprovided context sometimes!)
2) TL;DR (Too Long Didnt Read)- A common terminology on Reddit
3) One Line Summary ( Gives one sentence that **would** explain the whole text )
