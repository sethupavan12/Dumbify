# Dumbify
Dumbify is a Text Conversion Platform which can do the following when given text as an input:
1) Explain given text to a 2nd grader (This is wild! It can understand unprovided context sometimes!)
2) TL;DR (Too Long Didnt Read)- A common terminology on Reddit
3) One Line Summary ( Gives one sentence that **would** explain the whole text )

Dumbify is powered by OpenAI's API which uses cutting-edge GPT-3 model family's weights to processing natural language. 



**Deployment : Pending** but can use locally if you have access to OpenAI API beta [as of 25/Jul]
